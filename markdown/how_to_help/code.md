# How to help with the slidewinder code base

## Basics

If you're not familiar with Node.js/coffeescript, or you want a refresher on how to set up a project like this, we have some simple guides:

1. [Node.js and coffeescript](code/00_node_and_coffeescript.html)
2. [Setting up for slidewinder development](code/01_setting_up.html)

## Code style

We enforce a [coffeescript style guide](code/02_style_guide.html) - make sure you read it!.

The main `slidewinder` repo has an [`.editorconfig`](https://github.com/slidewinder/slidewinder/blob/master/.editorconfig) file. This allows your editor to automatically adopt many of our style conventions when you're working on files in that repo. This is especially useful if you often switch between projects.

See how to set up `.editorconfig` with your text editor at the [editorconfig site](http://editorconfig.org/).

## What kinds of help do we want?

We have a roadmap for the project, which is managed using Github Issues and milestones.

You can [browse the issues](https://github.com/slidewinder/slidewinder/issues
) by repo. Or if you [look at the milestones](https://github.com/slidewinder/slidewinder/milestones) for a repo, you can browse the issues by milestone.
