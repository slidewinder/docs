## How to help

slidewinder is a software project that aims to build an online community around open slide sharing.

This means we need help with:

- [writing the code](how_to_help/code.html)
- [designing the user experience](how_to_help/ux.html)
- [designing and creating visual assets](how_to_help/graphic_design.html)
- [writing documentation](how_to_help/documentation.html)
- [managing the community](how_to_help/community.html)

Have we missed something? Please let us know! You can tell us in [the live gitter chat](https://gitter.im/slidewinder/slidewinder), or [open an issue](https://github.com/slidewinder/docs/issues).
