        <h3 id="contributors-guide">Contributors&#39; guide</h3>
<p>So you&#39;re thinking of contributing to slidewinder - that&#39;s GREAT! We&#39;d love to have you. This document should help you get started.</p>
<h3 id="three-things-you-should-know">Three things you should know</h3>
<p>There are three things you should know:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is a friendly community. We want to welcome everyone who is interested. For this reason, we have rules about how people can behave in the community, and we <em>will</em> enforce them. The bottom line is that you must respect others, but you can read about what that means specifically below.</li>
<li>We are moving fast but want to maintain a high-quality project. For this reason we have specific working processes in place. We&#39;re strict about the standard of work we allow into the project - but we&#39;re nice about it! If you&#39;d like help contributing, we&#39;ll be happy to guide you.</li>
<li>We really care about our contributors, and we want to make it easy for you to become one. If our documentation is confusing, <em>that&#39;s our fault</em>. If it&#39;s not clear how you can get involved - <em>that&#39;s our fault</em>. If you&#39;re unsure of how to follow the rules, <em>that&#39;s our fault</em>. In any of those cases please <a href="https://gitter.im/slidewinder/slidewinder">come and tell us about it</a>, we&#39;ll fix things ASAP.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-community-code-of-conduct">The community code of conduct</h3>
<p>The internet is often an unfriendly place. Some people are systematically excluded from online spaces or made to feel unwelcome or uncomfortable. We don&#39;t want that to happen here. The more different voices and skillsets we have in the community, the more robust our decisions will be and the better our project will become.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not always obvious to people who create an unwelcoming atmosphere that they are doing so. So we&#39;ve got some specific rules that YOU MUST READ BEFORE CONTRIBUTING.</p>
<p><a href="docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Go and read the rules</a>.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-help-with-slidewinder">How to help with slidewinder</h3>
